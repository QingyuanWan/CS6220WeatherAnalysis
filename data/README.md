## Data Folder

This project uses two data files located in the `./data` folder:

- `weather-1.csv` (~37MB)
- `cleaned_weather.csv` (~8MB)

Due to GitHub file size limitations and push errors, **these files are not tracked in version control** and are listed in `.gitignore`.

### How to Get the Data

Please manually upload or download both files into the `./data` folder before running any notebooks or scripts.

You can get the files from a shared Google Drive link.
